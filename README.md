## Origin
This is a port of my [The ASP.NET Collatz Project](https://github.com/VincentSaelzler/CollatzConjecture). The goal was to create an ASP.NET *Core* based page.
## Paradigm
Originally, I was going to use the core MVC template. However, with the Razor Pages architecture described as a "simple way" to make quick apps, I decided to try it.

I actually think it works as advertised. It's a basic page, and all the interactions between views, routing, and controllers that are involved with MVC aren't necessary.
